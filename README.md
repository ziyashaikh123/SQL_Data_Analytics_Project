SQL_Data_Analytics_Project

📊 SQL Analytics & Reporting Scripts

This project is a collection of SQL queries designed for data exploration, analytics, and reporting.
It helps data analysts, BI professionals, and learners quickly analyze datasets and uncover insights without writing queries from scratch.

The scripts demonstrate best practices in SQL and cover:

🔎 Database exploration – understanding tables, columns, and relationships

📈 Time-based trends – analyzing growth over days, months, or years

➕ Cumulative analytics – tracking running totals and progress

🧮 Key metrics – calculating averages, counts, ratios, and KPIs

🧩 Segmentation – breaking data into categories like region, product, or customer group

📑 Reporting queries – generating summaries for dashboards and business reports

Each query focuses on a specific analytical theme and can be adapted for any relational database.
This project is implemented using MySQL.
